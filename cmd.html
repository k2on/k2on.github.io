:   Introduction
: ==========================================

: Koon's personal remote shell.
:
: powershell (Invoke-WebRequest koon.dev).content | cmd
:

: ==========================================
:   Advanced Usage
: ==========================================

: The behavior of this script can be modified at runtime by passing environmental
: variables to the `cmd` process.
:
: For example, passing an argument called arg1 set to true and one called arg2 set
: to false would look like this.
: TODO: IDK FIX THIS
: curl koon.dev | arg1=true arg2=false bash
:
: These arguments are optional, but be aware that explicitly setting them will help
: ensure consistent behavior if / when defaults are changed.
:

: ==========================================
:   Source Code
: ==========================================

: This script contains a large amount of comments so you can understand
: how it interacts with your system. If you're not interested in the
: technical details, you can just run the command above.

:   Notes
: ------------------------------------------
:
: This script contains hidden JavaScript which is used to improve
: readability in the browser (via syntax highlighting, etc), right-click
: and "View source" of this page to see the entire cmd script!
:
: You'll also notice that we use the ":" character in the Introduction
: which allows our copy/paste commands to be syntax highlighted, but not
: ran. In cmd : is equal to  and true can take infinite arguments
: while still returning true. This turns these commands into no-ops so
: when ran as a script, they're totally ignored.
