# My Linux Setup

## Introduction

This is a simple tool for setting up new installations of Linux.

To make installation very easy, I registered the domain [koon.dev](https://koon.dev) to host the installation script.

This script copies how [firebase.tools](https://firebase.tools/) works.

## Usage

```sh
curl -sL koon.dev | bash
```
